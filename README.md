# Note-Taker
Added the required front end files
Created the server on port 3000 under title server.js
Created a html route and api routes page in js
Created a Heroku file and made sure it was linked to teh GitHub repo
Built the server and tested that it ran
In the htmlRoutes page I retrieved the data from the notes.html page and the index.html page using the get method
Using get I  retrieved the data from the db.json file
I then used post to post the notes data to teh db.json file and gave each note posted a unique id
Using delete I was able to target the unique id stated in the url and have that note deleted if requested.
Deployed to Heroku and GitHub
